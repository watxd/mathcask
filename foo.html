  **Determination of the Number of Electrons Transferred per Mole of Sulfur Formed**

---

**Overall Reaction (Target Product: Sulfur)**

$$
\text{H}_2\text{S} \rightarrow \text{S} + \text{H}_2
$$

---

**Step 1: Identify the Half-Reactions**

**Anodic (Oxidation) Half-Reaction:**

$$
\text{H}_2\text{S} \rightarrow 2\text{H}^+ + \text{S} + 2e^-
$$

This represents the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur. Two electrons are released per mole of Hâ‚‚S oxidized.

**Cathodic (Reduction) Half-Reaction:**

$$
2\text{H}^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2
$$

This corresponds to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which consumes the two electrons produced during oxidation.

---

**Step 2: Determine Moles of Electrons Transferred**

From the oxidation half-reaction:

$$
\text{H}_2\text{S} \rightarrow \text{S} + 2e^-
$$

This shows that 2 moles of electrons are transferred for every 1 mole of sulfur formed.

---

**Step 3: Apply the Formula**

$$
n = \frac{\text{mol of electrons transferred}}{\text{mol of sulfur produced}} = \frac{2}{1}
$$

---

**Final Result**

$$
n = 2
$$
