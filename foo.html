Here’s the rewritten version with explicit units for the gas constant \( R \) and temperature \( T \), while keeping everything else the same:  

---

If we observe that \( E_2 \) has the lowest activation energy, higher selectivity is achieved at lower temperatures. However, this comes at the cost of a reduced reaction rate for species \( B \), leading to lower production of \( B \) as temperature decreases. Therefore, a balance must be struck between achieving high selectivity and maintaining sufficient production. To accomplish this, we require expressions for \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) as functions of temperature. From the provided data, we know:  

\[ k_i = A_i \, e^{\left( \frac{-E_i}{R T} \right)} \]  

where:  
- \( R = 1.98 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \) (gas constant)  
- \( T \) is in **Kelvin (K)**  

Given the rate constants at \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \), we can solve for \( A_i \):  

\[ A_1 = \frac{0.004 \, (\text{mol/dm}^3)^{1/2} \cdot \text{min}^{-1}}{e^{\left( \frac{-20000 \, \text{cal/mol}}{1.98 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \times 300 \, \text{K}} \right)}} = 1.49 \times 10^{12} \, (\text{mol/dm}^3)^{1/2} \cdot \text{min}^{-1} \]  

\[ A_2 = \frac{0.3 \, \text{min}^{-1}}{e^{\left( \frac{-10000 \, \text{cal/mol}}{1.98 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \times 300 \, \text{K}} \right)}} = 5.79 \times 10^6 \, \text{min}^{-1} \]  

\[ A_3 = \frac{0.25 \, \text{dm}^3/\text{mol} \cdot \text{min}}{e^{\left( \frac{-30000 \, \text{cal/mol}}{1.98 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \times 300 \, \text{K}} \right)}} = 1.798 \times 10^{21} \, \text{dm}^3/\text{mol} \cdot \text{min} \]  

The mole balance on species \( A \) is given by:  

\[ V = \frac{F_{A0} - F_A}{-r_A} \]  

\[ V = \frac{v(C_{A0} - C_A)}{-r_A} \]  

\[ \tau = \frac{C_{A0} - C_A}{-r_A} = \frac{C_{A0} - C_A}{k_1 C_A^{0.5} + k_2 C_A + k_3 C_A^2} \]  

For the other species, the mole balance yields:  

\[ F_i = v C_i = r_i V \]  

\[ C_i = \tau r_i \]  

---  

### Key Changes:  
1. Explicitly stated the units of \( R \) (**cal/(mol·K)**) and \( T \) (**K**).  
2. Kept all other equations, notation, and units unchanged.  
3. Maintained consistency with the original problem statement.
