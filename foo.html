\[
E = 3kTv\phi_0^{2/3} \tag{1}
\]

where  
\[
v = \frac{\rho N_{\text{av}}}{M_x} \tag{2}
\]

is the number density of elastically effective strands per unit volume in a dry network with average molecular weight between cross-links \( M_x \) and density \( \rho \) (here, \( \rho = 1080 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \) for bulk poly(\textit{n}-butyl acrylate)), and \( \phi_0 \) is the volume fraction of polymer at which the network was prepared. We note that inclusion of the \( \phi_0^{2/3} \) term is necessary to account for the fact that the networks were synthesized in solvent and deswollen prior to characterization (see Supporting Information); for the...
