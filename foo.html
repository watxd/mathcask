Here is a table summarizing the applications, advantages, and disadvantages of selected fabrication methods, using the exact wording from the file:

| **Fabrication Method** | **Applications**                                  | **Advantages**                                                                 | **Disadvantages**                                                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hand Lay-up**        | Large commercial parts, where cost is more important than high strength or low weight | - Low cost tools<br>- Versatile: wide range of products<br>- Relatively low cost tooling | - Time consuming<br>- Easy to form air bubbles and disorientation of fibers<br>- Inconsistency |
| **Vacuum Bag Moulding** | Large commercial parts, where cost is more important than high strength or low weight | - Simple design<br>- Any fiber/matrix combination<br>- Better quality for the cost | - Cannot be heated up too much<br>- Low pressure (760 mm Hg the most)<br>- Slowest speed |
| **Autoclave Moulding** | High performance military and aerospace components and thermal cores | - High quality<br>- High strength<br>- Elevated pressure yields low void content | - Relatively high cost of tooling<br>- Size limited by autoclave<br>- High fiber volume fraction requires elevated pressure |
| **Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM)** | Military and aerospace applications, large-volume commercial parts, small enclosures and keyboards | - Good surface finish on both sides<br>- Selective reinforcement and accurate fiber management<br>- Low pressure injection | - Waste some material (spill)<br>- Curing time long<br>- Hard for intricate parts |
| **Compression Moulding** | Electronic module covers and small electronic enclosures | - Wide range of shapes<br>- Consistency<br>- Structural stability | - High cost of machine<br>- Expensive molds (strong materials required)<br>- No intricate parts |
| **Filament Winding**   | Gas tanks, aerospace parts, compressed air tanks, sail boat masts | - Quick, easy to handle package<br>- Parts can have huge size<br>- Low manufacturing costs if high throughput | - Shape of the products limited (only cylindrical possible)<br>- Curing by heat is not easy to apply<br>- Spinning speed is limited |
| **Injection Moulding** | Complex geometries with tight tolerances, wide range of materials and colors | - Very efficient<br>- High repeatability and reliability<br>- Reuse material | - Start-up costs are high<br>- Initial lead times are long<br>- Design changes are expensive |
| **3D Printing**        | Customized and complex geometries, lightweight design, small-batch production | - Material efficiency<br>- Reduced lead times<br>- On-demand manufacturing | - Limited material choices<br>- Mechanical properties variability<br>- Print size limitations |
