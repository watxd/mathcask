| **Fabrication Method** | **Process** | **Applications** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|------------------------|------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Hand Lay-up** | Manual application of resin and reinforcement onto a mold; cures without additional treatment. | Large commercial parts, where cost > high strength/low weight. | - Low-cost tools<br>- Versatile<br>- Relatively low-cost tooling | - Time-consuming<br>- Air bubbles/fiber disorientation<br>- Inconsistency |
| **Spray Lay-up** | Chopped fibers + resin sprayed onto a mold; cures at ambient temperature. | Large, low-cost parts (e.g., boat hulls). | - Continuous process<br>- Correctable errors (re-spray)<br>- Any mold material | - Slow<br>- Inconsistent<br>- No fiber control |
| **Liquid Resin Moulding** | Liquid resin + curing agent poured into a mold; hardens into solid polymer. | Simple, large parts (e.g., panels). | - Simple design<br>- Low pressure | - Limited to low-viscosity resins<br>- Long curing time |
| **Prepreg Forming** | Pre-impregnated fibers cut/stacked; cured under heat/pressure. | Aerospace, high-performance parts. | - Consistent fiber alignment<br>- High productivity | - Limited shelf life<br>- Delamination risk |
| **Vacuum Bag Moulding** | Laminate compressed under vacuum bag; cured with ambient/elevated heat. | Improved hand lay-up parts (e.g., marine). | - Better consolidation<br>- Cheap molds | - Low pressure (760 mmHg max)<br>- Slow |
| **Pressure Bag Moulding** | Similar to vacuum bagging but uses positive pressure. | High-quality curved parts. | - Higher pressure than vacuum | - Complex setup<br>- Rigid molds required |
| **Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM)** | Resin injected into closed mold with dry reinforcement. | Aerospace, automotive (e.g., enclosures). | - Good surface finish<br>- Low emissions | - Long curing<br>- Material waste |
| **Compression Moulding** | Preheated material compressed in mold under heat/pressure. | Electronic covers, small enclosures. | - High consistency<br>- Structural stability | - Expensive molds<br>- No intricate parts |
| **Autoclave Moulding** | Cured under elevated heat/pressure in an autoclave. | Aerospace/military (e.g., thermal cores). | - Highest strength-to-weight<br>- Low voids | - High tooling cost<br>- Size-limited |
| **Pultrusion** | Fibers pulled through resin bath + heated die for curing. | Constant cross-sections (e.g., rods, beams). | - High-speed<br>- Automated | - Expensive dies<br>- Limited shapes |
| **Filament Winding** | Resin-coated fibers wound around a rotating mandrel. | Cylindrical parts (e.g., tanks, pipes). | - Fast for large parts<br>- Low cost | - Only axisymmetric shapes |
| **Injection Moulding** | Molten polymer injected into mold under pressure. | Complex geometries (e.g., consumer goods). | - High repeatability<br>- Reusable material | - High startup cost<br>- Design inflexibility |
| **3D Printing (Polymer Composites)** | Layer-by-layer deposition of composite material. | Customized, lightweight designs. | - On-demand production<br>- Complex geometries | - Variable properties<br>- Size limitations |
