Certainly. Below is an academic-style breakdown of the **Pulsa Series® 7120 diaphragm metering pump**, including:

1. Explanation of how flow rate, pressure, and stroke length correlate
2. Summary performance table based on datasheet values
3. Interpretation of the **flow vs. pressure vs. stroke** graph

## **1. Working Principle and Correlation: Flow, Pressure, and Stroke**

The **PulsaPro® 7120** is a **hydraulic diaphragm metering pump** that operates on a **positive displacement principle**. Each stroke of the diaphragm displaces a fixed volume of fluid. The overall flow rate (Q) depends on:

* **Stroke frequency** (SPM, strokes per minute)
* **Stroke length** (adjustable from 0–100%)
* **Displacement volume per stroke** (which varies by piston size)

### **Basic Equation**

$$
Q = V_s \times SPM \times \frac{\text{Stroke %}}{100}
$$

Where:

* $Q$: Flow rate (L/min or GPH)
* $V_s$: Displacement volume per full stroke (L or G)
* $\text{Stroke %}$: Set stroke length (0–100%)
* $SPM$: Stroke rate (typically 70 or 175 SPM for 60 Hz operation)

### **Effect of Pressure**

* Flow rate remains relatively **independent of discharge pressure** up to the pump’s rated limit (due to its **positive displacement** nature).
* However, at **higher pressures**, minor **internal losses** and **diaphragm deflection limitations** can reduce net flow capacity slightly.
* In the datasheets, **flow ratings decrease as pressure increases**, which is captured empirically in the pump’s **flow-pressure-stroke graph**.

## **3. Graph Interpretation: Flow vs Pressure vs Stroke (Piston Size)**

The **flow-pressure-stroke chart** from the Pulsa 7120 datasheet shows curves for various **piston diameters** (1.0" to 2.62") with **stroke lengths (in inches)** on the X-axis and **corresponding flow rate and pressure limits** on the Y-axis.

### **Key Observations**

* **Larger piston sizes** yield **higher flow** at a given stroke and frequency.
* As **stroke length increases**, **flow increases linearly**—confirming the sinusoidal motion output.
* At **higher backpressures**, **flow output drops**, especially for larger pistons, due to diaphragm flexibility limits and internal compression losses.
* The graph aligns with the flow equation and reflects **empirical correction for real-world conditions** (e.g., viscous losses, hydraulic deflection).

### **Empirical Trend**

From the graph:

$$
\text{Flow} \propto \text{Stroke length (in)} \quad \text{(for constant SPM and piston size)}
$$

At full stroke, flow approaches the maximum rated values (e.g., 923 LPH at 2.62" piston).

## **Conclusion**

The **PulsaPro 7120** offers **precise, linear flow control** via stroke length and piston size. The correlation between flow, pressure, and stroke is **quantifiable and tunable**, allowing for accurate dosing across a wide range of chemical applications. However, users must consider pressure-flow tradeoffs and adjust stroke accordingly to maintain dosing accuracy under varying line pressures.

Would you like a plotted version of the correlation graph or a case study simulation (e.g., in Excel or MATLAB) to predict flow for certain settings?
