The given equation is a **6th-degree polynomial**:

\[ y = -28.148x^6 + 102.01x^5 - 142.1x^4 + 98x^3 - 34.977x^2 + 6.1905x \]

### Key Observations:
1. **Degree**: The highest power is \( x^6 \), making it a **sextic (6th-degree) polynomial**.
2. **Leading Coefficient**: Negative (\(-28.148\)), so as \( x \to \pm\infty \), \( y \to -\infty \).
3. **Roots**: One obvious root is \( x = 0 \). The other roots would require solving the quintic equation obtained by factoring out \( x \):
   \[
   -28.148x^5 + 102.01x^4 - 142.1x^3 + 98x^2 - 34.977x + 6.1905 = 0
   \]
   This may not have closed-form solutions and might need numerical methods (e.g., Newton-Raphson) for approximation.
4. **Behavior**: High-degree polynomials can have multiple maxima, minima, and inflection points. The exact number and location of these critical points would require calculus (taking the derivative and solving \( y' = 0 \)).

### Possible Applications:
- **Curve Fitting**: This polynomial might model a set of data points.
- **Approximation**: It could approximate a more complex function over a specific interval.

Would you like help with:
1. Finding roots numerically?
2. Analyzing critical points (maxima/minima)?
3. Plotting the function over a specific range?
4. Factoring or simplifying further?
