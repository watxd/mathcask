Here's the enhanced table with **all** advantages and disadvantages from the file, while maintaining the original wording and adding more details where available:

---

| **Fabrication Method** | **Process** | **Applications** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|------------------------|------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Hand Lay-up** | Manual application of resin and reinforcement onto a mold; cures without additional treatment. | Large commercial parts where cost > high strength/low weight. | - Low-cost tools<br>- Versatile: wide range of products<br>- Relatively low cost tooling<br>- Large parts possible | - Time-consuming<br>- Easy to form air bubbles and disorientation of fibers<br>- Inconsistency<br>- Only one side finished |
| **Spray Lay-up** | Chopped fibers + resin sprayed onto a mold; cures at ambient temperature. | Large, low-cost parts (e.g., boat hulls, simple panels). | - Continuous process<br>- Any materials can be used as mold<br>- Error can be corrected by re-spraying<br>- Low skill requirement | - Slow<br>- Inconsistency<br>- No control of fiber orientation<br>- Only one side finished<br>- Environmental unfriendly |
| **Liquid Resin Moulding** | Liquid resin mixed with curing agent poured into mold; hardens into solid polymer. | Simple, large parts with basic shapes. | - Simple process<br>- Low equipment cost<br>- Suitable for large parts | - Limited to low-viscosity resins<br>- Long curing time<br>- Limited fiber control<br>- Potential for voids |
| **Prepreg Forming** | Pre-impregnated fibers cut/stacked; cured under heat/pressure. | Aerospace, high-performance components. | - Orientation of fibers can be changed<br>- Consistent quality<br>- High productivity<br>- Excellent fiber/resin ratio | - Continuous process needs more customers<br>- Limited shelf life<br>- Delamination risk<br>- High material cost |
| **Vacuum Bag Moulding** | Laminate compressed under vacuum bag; cured with ambient/elevated heat. | Improved quality parts over hand lay-up. | - Simple design<br>- Any fiber/matrix combination<br>- OK with cheap mold material<br>- Better quality for the cost | - Cannot be heated up too much<br>- Breather cloth has to be replaced frequently<br>- Low pressure (760 mm Hg max)<br>- Slowest speed<br>- Inconsistency |
| **Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM)** | Resin injected into closed mold with dry reinforcement. | Aerospace, automotive, enclosures. | - Good surface finish on both sides<br>- Selective reinforcement possible<br>- Fiber loading up to 65%<br>- Low volatile emissions<br>- Near net shape possible | - Waste some material (spill)<br>- Curing time long<br>- Hard for intricate parts<br>- Higher tooling cost than hand lay-up |
| **Compression Moulding** | Preheated material compressed in mold under heat/pressure. | Electronic covers, small enclosures. | - Wide range of shapes<br>- Integration of parts possible<br>- Consistency<br>- Structural stability<br>- Relatively simple | - High cost of machine<br>- Time consuming heating/cooling<br>- Expensive molds required<br>- No intricate parts<br>- Needs large production volume |
| **Autoclave Moulding** | Cured under elevated heat/pressure in autoclave. | Aerospace/military high-performance parts. | - Highest quality<br>- Highest strength-to-weight<br>- Low void content<br>- Maximum structural efficiency | - Relatively high cost of tooling<br>- Size limited by autoclave<br>- Long cycle times<br>- High energy consumption |
| **Pultrusion** | Fibers pulled through resin bath + heated die for curing. | Constant cross-sections (beams, rods). | - Automated process<br>- High speed<br>- Versatile cross-sectional shape<br>- Continuous reinforcement | - Die can be easily messed up<br>- Expensive die<br>- Mainly thermoset matrix<br>- Limited to straight sections |
| **Filament Winding** | Resin-coated fibers wound around rotating mandrel. | Cylindrical parts (tanks, pipes, masts). | - Using existing textile processes<br>- Quick, easy to handle package<br>- Parts can have huge size<br>- Low manufacturing costs at high throughput | - Spinning speed limited<br>- Curing by heat not easy to apply<br>- Shape limited to cylindrical<br>- Traveler speed limitations |
| **Injection Moulding** | Molten polymer injected into mold under pressure. | Complex geometries (consumer goods). | - Complex geometries with tight tolerances<br>- Wide material/color range<br>- Very efficient<br>- High repeatability<br>- Material reuse possible | - High startup costs<br>- Long initial lead times<br>- Expensive design changes<br>- Limited by part size |
| **3D Printing (Polymer Composites)** | Layer-by-layer deposition of composite material. | Customized, complex, lightweight parts. | - Customization and complex geometries<br>- Material efficiency<br>- Tailored properties<br>- Reduced lead times<br>- Lightweight design<br>- Cost-effective for small batches | - Limited material choices<br>- Mechanical properties variability<br>- Surface finish issues<br>- Print size limitations<br>- High printer/material costs<br>- Post-processing needed |
