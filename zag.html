# Introduction (4 marks)

**Importance & real-life applications**
Cooling towers are central to industrial process cooling—the largest single consumer of water in industry. They provide a dependable, low-cost way to reject low-grade heat and can cool water *below ambient dry-bulb temperature* by leveraging evaporative cooling. Because of this, they’re ubiquitous in power plants, refineries and chemical plants; they also appear in HVAC systems for large buildings, data centers, and district cooling loops. Key factors that govern performance include air flow rate, water flow rate and temperature, inlet air wet-bulb temperature and humidity, and packing type/area/volume.

**Theoretical background (brief)**
A counter/cross-flow packed tower brings warm water into contact with unsaturated air. A small fraction of the water evaporates into the air stream; the remaining water is cooled predominantly by the latent heat of evaporation. For an ideal adiabatic tower, the *lowest* achievable water temperature approaches the inlet-air wet-bulb temperature, so performance is often expressed using **cooling range** and **approach to wet bulb**. Overall behavior is described by coupled mass/energy balances, psychrometrics (humidity ratio, enthalpy, relative humidity), and Merkel’s method for mass transfer, which relates the tower’s volumetric transfer capacity (KaV) to operating conditions and packing.

**Equations used (with explanations & notation)**

*Performance metrics*

1. **Capacity (heat removed from water)**
   [
   \dot Q = \dot m_w, c_{p,w},(T_{w,in}-T_{w,out})
   ]
   Heat removed from the circulating water; (\dot m_w) is water mass flow, (c_{p,w}) water specific heat. 

2. **Cooling range**
   [
   \text{Range}= T_{w,in}-T_{w,out}
   ]
   Temperature drop of the water across the tower. 

3. **Approach to wet bulb**
   [
   \text{Approach}= T_{w,out}-T_{wb,in}
   ]
   How close the outlet water gets to the inlet-air wet-bulb temperature. 

*Mass balances* (see Fig. 3)
4) **Dry air is conserved:** (\ \dot m_{a1}=\dot m_{a2}=\dot m_a).
5) **Total water (liquid + vapor carried by air):** (\ \dot m_{w1}+\omega_{a1}\dot m_a=\dot m_{w2}+\omega_{a2}\dot m_a).
6) **Evaporation rate:** (\ \dot m_{w1}-\dot m_{w2}=\dot m_a(\omega_{a2}-\omega_{a1})).
Here (\omega) is humidity ratio (kg moisture/kg dry air). 

*Energy balances*
7) **Overall energy:** (\ \dot m_{w1}h_{w1}+\dot m_a h_{a1}= \dot m_{w2}h_{w2}+\dot m_a h_{a2}).
8) **Water–air difference form:** (\ \dot m_{w1}h_{w1}-\dot m_{w2}h_{w2}= \dot m_a(h_{a2}-h_{a1})).
9) **Practical approximation:** (\ \dot m_w c_{p,w}(T_{w1}-T_{w2})\approx \dot m_a(h_{a2}-h_{a1})).
Air/water specific enthalpies are (h_a,h_w); temperatures (T_{w1},T_{w2}) are water in/out. 

*Psychrometrics*
10) **Relative humidity:** (\ \phi = P_s/P_{sat,w}).
11) **Regnault/August/Apjohn relation:** (\ P_s= P_{sat,w}-6.666\times10^{-4}P_t (T_{db}-T_{wb})).
12) **Moist-air enthalpy (with superheat):** (\ h=h_s + c_{p,\text{steam}}\times(\text{degrees of superheat})).
13) **Specific volume of water vapor:** (\ \nu=\dfrac{R_0 T}{M P}).
14) **Ideal-gas form (molar):** (\ V=\dfrac{nR_0T}{P}) (linking to 13 via (M)).
15) **Enthalpy change rate (air):** (\ \Delta \dot h = \dot m_a (h_B - h_A)).
(P_t) is total pressure; (T_{db}, T_{wb}) are dry- and wet-bulb temperatures; (h_s) saturated-steam enthalpy; (R_0) universal gas constant; (M) molar mass; (A,B) denote air states at column base/top. 

*Merkel (characteristic) method*
16) **Differential form:** (\ c_{p,w},\dot m_w,dT = K,a,dV,(\Delta h)).
17–18) **Integrated form:** (\ \dfrac{KaV}{\dot m_w}=c_{p,w}\int \dfrac{dT}{\Delta h}).
19) **Numerical form:** (\ \dfrac{KaV}{\dot m_w}= c_{p,w}\dfrac{T_{in,w}-T_{out,w}}{\Delta h_m}), where (\Delta h_m) is the corrected mean enthalpy driving force.
20) **Characteristic equation (empirical fit):** (\ \dfrac{KaV}{\dot m_w}=\lambda\left(\dfrac{\dot m_w}{\dot m_a}\right)^n), with (\lambda,n) constants for the packing.
Here (K) is mass-transfer coefficient, (a) interfacial area, (V) packing volume, (\Delta h) air-side enthalpy driving force. 

*Key notation (subset)*
(\dot m_w, \dot m_a): water/air mass flow (kg·s⁻¹) · (T): temperature (°C or K) · (h): specific enthalpy (kJ·kg⁻¹) · (\omega): humidity ratio (kg/kg dry air) · (\phi): relative humidity (–) · (\nu): specific volume (m³·kg⁻¹) · (K): mass-transfer coeff. · (a): contact area (m²·m⁻³ when combined with (V)). Full nomenclature appears in the handout.

**Brief procedure of the experiment**

1. **Preparation:** Fill make-up tank; verify wet-bulb reservoirs and load-tank level; power on. Set damper and water valve to moderate flows; allow ~5 min to stabilize. 
2. **Software & data:** Launch the Hilton program; input calibration/pressure/packing data; view psychrometric chart and schematic; select Program 3 to log raw & calculated values. 
3. **Runs:** At steady state, log data across **four loads** (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 kW). Repeat the sequence for a **lower air-flow** setting. 
4. **Make-up water:** Measure make-up flow by timed volume (weigh ~150 g added; time to drop back to mark). 
5. **Outputs:** Plot **Approach to Wet Bulb vs Total Cooling Load** at two air flows; compare experimental and calculated make-up rates; discuss discrepancies.
