# **Derivation of the Design Equation for a Batch Reactor**

### **General Mole Balance Equation**
The design equation for a batch reactor is derived from the **general mole balance** for a chemical species \( i \) in a reactor:

\[
\text{Accumulation} = \text{Input} - \text{Output} + \text{Generation} - \text{Consumption}
\]

### **Assumptions for a Batch Reactor**
1. **No input or output streams** (closed system).  
   → \(\text{Input} = 0\), \(\text{Output} = 0\).  
2. **Accumulation** = Rate of change of moles of \( i \) in the reactor.  
   → \(\text{Accumulation} = \frac{dN_i}{dt}\).  
3. **Net generation** = Reaction rate × Volume.  
   → \(\text{Generation} - \text{Consumption} = r_i V\).  

### **Applying the Mole Balance**
Substituting the terms into the general mole balance:

\[
\frac{dN_i}{dt} = 0 - 0 + r_i V
\]

Thus, the **differential form** of the batch reactor design equation is:

\[
\frac{dN_i}{dt} = r_i V
\]

### **Integral Form (Time Required for Reaction)**
To find the time \( t \) required to reach a certain conversion, we rearrange and integrate:

\[
dt = \frac{dN_i}{r_i V}
\]

\[
t = \int_{N_{i0}}^{N_{if}} \frac{dN_i}{r_i V}
\]

Where:
- \( N_{i0} \) = Initial moles of \( i \).
- \( N_{if} \) = Final moles of \( i \).
- \( r_i \) = Reaction rate (depends on kinetics).
- \( V \) = Reactor volume (constant for liquid-phase reactions).

### **Special Case: Constant Volume (Liquid-Phase Reactions)**
For **constant volume** (e.g., liquid-phase reactions), we express the equation in terms of **concentration** (\( C_i = N_i / V \)):

\[
\frac{dC_i}{dt} = r_i
\]

The **integral form** becomes:

\[
t = \int_{C_{i0}}^{C_{if}} \frac{dC_i}{r_i}
\]

### **Summary of Key Equations**
| Form | Equation | Application |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Differential** | \(\frac{dN_i}{dt} = r_i V\) | General mole balance |
| **Integral** | \(t = \int \frac{dN_i}{r_i V}\) | Batch time calculation |
| **Constant \( V \)** | \(\frac{dC_i}{dt} = r_i\) | Liquid-phase reactions |

This derivation shows how the batch reactor design equation is obtained from a mole balance and how it can be applied to determine reaction time. The final form depends on whether the reactor volume changes (gas-phase reactions) or remains constant (liquid-phase reactions).
