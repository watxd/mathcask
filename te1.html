Based on the given table, the polynomial can be written as:

\[ P(x) = 12.15297x^1 - 132.113x^2 + 788.7002x^3 - 2704.91x^4 + 5269.555x^5 - 5010.65x^6 + 0x^7 + 4737.142x^8 - 4125.71x^9 + 1166.803x^{10} \]

Simplifying by omitting the term with a zero coefficient (the \( 0x^7 \) term), the polynomial becomes:

\[ P(x) = 12.15297x - 132.113x^2 + 788.7002x^3 - 2704.91x^4 + 5269.555x^5 - 5010.65x^6 + 4737.142x^8 - 4125.71x^9 + 1166.803x^{10} \]

This is a 10th-degree polynomial with no constant term (0th power).
