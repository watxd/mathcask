Sustainable Polymer Composite Structures in Marine Applications

**Report Name:**  
Design and Development of Eco-Friendly Marine Vessels Using Polymer Composites

---

### 1. Introduction and Background (30%)

Polymer composites have been integral to marine vessel construction for over 50 years, utilized in a broad range of applications including hulls, decks, masts, foils, propellers, and underwater structures. Traditionally, the marine industry has favored glass fiber reinforced thermoset polymers—particularly polyester and epoxy resins—due to their ease of processing, good mechanical properties, and low cost [1]. These materials offered a leap from wooden boatbuilding, significantly lowering maintenance requirements and enabling the rapid production of complex shapes.

Today, composite materials remain prevalent in both pleasure craft and high-performance racing yachts, as well as military and commercial vessels. Their benefits lie primarily in their high specific strength (strength-to-weight ratio), corrosion resistance, and potential for optimization through fiber orientation. The knock-on effect of weight savings is significant: smaller engines, reduced fuel consumption, and ultimately lower emissions (Fig. 3) [6].

However, the marine environment is particularly harsh: structures must endure UV exposure, seawater ingress, high pressures from wave impacts, and biofouling. This necessitates the use of resins and fibers that can withstand prolonged service life under aggressive conditions. For instance, early examples like HMS Wilton, constructed in the 1970s from monolithic GRP, are still operational today [1].

Sustainability, now a central design criterion alongside performance, cost, and manufacturability, mandates attention to a vessel's full life cycle. From raw material selection to manufacturing, use, and end-of-life disposal or recycling, every phase contributes to environmental impact. Eco-design practices now include life cycle assessment (LCA), value analysis, waste reduction, CO2 storage via bio-based materials, and provisions for repairability and traceability [1].

Figures 1 and 2 of the reference article present strong vs. weak sustainability models and the selection criteria for hull materials. A life cycle approach is shown to significantly influence fuel consumption and emissions. For instance, Burman et al. [19] compared aluminum and composite patrol boats, finding that carbon fiber sandwich structures reduced lifetime fuel use by 20% [1]. Similarly, Cucinotta et al. [20] found that vacuum infusion reduced raw material use and long-term fuel needs compared to hand lay-up [1].

### 2. Current Materials: Advantages and Disadvantages (10%)

The most commonly used material in boat construction is glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP), primarily due to its cost-effectiveness, good strength properties, and durability. GFRP has dominated the market since the mid-20th century, replacing wood due to easier maintenance and mass-production feasibility [1]. Examples like the Goliff and Sangria production yachts underscore this trend, with over 2000 units produced in some models.

Advantages of GFRP include high corrosion resistance, light weight, and ease of forming complex geometries. However, disadvantages include poor recyclability, low performance compared to advanced composites, and difficulty in end-of-life material separation due to mixed cores and adhesives. With increasing regulatory pressure and sustainability concerns, these limitations are becoming critical.

High-performance vessels now rely on carbon fiber composites, offering superior modulus, fatigue life, and weight savings. These materials are essential in foils, rudders, and racing hulls, where optimization of hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads is necessary. Yet, carbon fibers are costly and extremely energy-intensive to produce (up to 1150 MJ/kg), with associated CO2 emissions as high as 30.1 kg/kg (Table 1) [1].

Sandwich construction using foam cores or honeycomb (e.g., Nomex™, PET, PVC) allows stiffness enhancement without major weight penalties. However, their composite nature makes recycling challenging. Thermoplastics like polypropylene and PLA, though recyclable, suffer from lower mechanical performance and surface adhesion issues (e.g., paintability) [1].

### 3. Research Gap (10%)

Despite the promising developments in recyclable and bio-based composites, their integration into mainstream marine vessel construction remains limited. Several issues contribute to this gap:

- **Lack of Standardization and Data:** Long-term marine performance data for new materials like Recyclamine™ epoxies and Elium™ acrylics are limited, hindering certification and industrial adoption [1].
- **Manufacturing Compatibility:** New resins require adaptation of existing processes. Although some (like Recyclamine™) are compatible with vacuum infusion, others need temperature and pressure controls that small shipyards may not afford.
- **End-of-Life Complexity:** Many vessels use mixed-material designs with adhesives and cores (e.g., wood, foam), lacking clear recyclability pathways and material traceability [1].
- **Cost Factors:** Advanced thermoplastics and bio-based fibers are often more expensive, limiting their adoption in low-cost segments of the marine industry.
- **Performance vs. Sustainability Trade-offs:** Natural fibers or thermoplastics may reduce emissions but compromise mechanical properties and durability, especially in high-load or long-service applications [1].

### 4. Strategies, Research Approaches, and Proposed Solutions (30%)

Several strategies have been developed to address the sustainability and recyclability challenges in marine composite applications:

- **Recyclable Thermosets:** Recyclamine™-based epoxies allow post-use recovery via solvent breakdown. These can be processed using standard techniques and have shown good retention of properties after seawater aging [42].

- **Thermoplastic Composites:** These include PP, PLA, PA6, and PEEK matrices, which can be reformed or ground. Marine demonstrators include flax/PLA canoes (NAVECOMAT) and PP/glass catamarans (Twincat 15) (Fig. 9, 10). Challenges remain in surface coating and processing temperatures [1].

- **Self-Healing Materials:** Inspired by biological systems, materials like vitrimers allow repeated repair via thermal triggers. This extends service life and may reduce structural redundancy in design [56].

- **AFP and 3D Printing:** Automated Fiber Placement improves fiber alignment and reduces waste. Used extensively in IMOCA foils, AFP enables complex 3D geometries and higher delamination resistance (Fig. 15, 16) [1].

- **Sandwich Core Innovation:** Recycled PET foam, cork, and balsa provide eco-friendly alternatives to PVC, with growing LCA data validating their use [103].

- **End-of-Life Strategies:** APER in France manages vessel deconstruction, supported by producer responsibility laws. Still, 63% of waste in 2020 went to incineration due to technical and economic barriers to composite recycling [1].

**Proposed Solution:**

To further enhance sustainability:
- Employ modular hulls with disassemblable joints.
- Expand AFP use for hulls and appendages to reduce waste.
- Develop universal labeling/tracking for composite components.
- Incentivize use of SRTPs and recycled PET foams.
- Adopt RTM with thermoplastic in-situ polymerization (e.g., Elium™, Bruggolen®) [1].

### 5. Expected Results / Conclusions (10%)

Sustainable marine composite development is increasingly essential for both environmental compliance and long-term viability. Adoption of recyclable resins, thermoplastics, and bio-based fibers can significantly reduce emissions, waste, and environmental degradation.

AFP and RTM technologies show promise in minimizing material waste and improving fiber performance, while recyclable thermosets like Recyclamine™ and Elium™ bridge the gap between ease of processing and sustainability.

Studies like the MarineShift360 LCA analysis of foil production demonstrate that emissions can be reduced fourfold by using 3D reinforcement and avoiding molds (Table 2) [1]. A complete IMOCA yacht still emits over 500 tonnes CO2e during construction, illustrating the urgent need for material and process changes [127].

Future work should focus on integrating sustainable materials without compromising marine performance, developing universal recycling protocols, and incentivizing lifecycle transparency through regulations and industry cooperation.
