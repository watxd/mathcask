**Addressing Reviewers' Comments on the Last Page:**

### **1. Chemical Engineering (CHE) Contributions:**
**Comment:**  
*"CHE contribution is absent. No engineering design is mentioned. Students should design the electrochemical distiller based on engineering/mathematical principles."*  

**Actions Taken:**  
- **Added detailed design components:**  
  - **Electrochemical Reactor Design:** CHE students will calculate reaction kinetics (e.g., Tafel equation for electrode efficiency) and optimize parameters (voltage, temperature, electrolyte concentration) using AspenTech simulations.  
  - **Material Selection:** Conduct experiments to compare graphite vs. stainless steel electrodes, evaluating degradation rates (<5% per 1000 hours) and conductivity.  
  - **Safety Protocols:** Design fail-safe mechanisms for electrolyte handling (e.g., neutralization tanks for acid/base spills).  

**Revised Section:**  
> *"CHE students will **design the electrochemical reactor** using mass/energy balance models and AspenTech simulations to achieve ≥80% desulfurization efficiency. Electrode materials will be tested under varying voltages (5–45V DC) to validate lifespan constraints. Safety systems (e.g., automated pH neutralization) will be prototyped."*

### **2. Electrical Engineering (EE) Contributions:**
**Comment:**  
*"EE contributions are too general. Safety components and prototyping feasibility are unclear."*  

**Actions Taken:**  
- **Specified safety and control systems:**  
  - **Circuit Protection:** Implement fuses, current limiters, and isolation transformers to prevent overloads.  
  - **Automated Shutoff:** Integrate Arduino-based monitoring to trigger shutdowns if temperature exceeds 75°C or current surpasses 5A.  
  - **Precision Control:** Use PID algorithms to maintain ±1V accuracy via feedback loops.  

**Revised Section:**  
> *"EE students will **design a protected power supply** (0–50V DC, ≤5A) with Arduino-controlled shutoffs for overheating/overcurrent. PID loops will adjust voltage dynamically. All circuits will comply with IEC 61010 safety standards."*

### **3. Industrial & Systems Engineering (ISE) Contributions:**
**Comment:**  
*"ISE contributions lack specificity. Tools and roadmap are unclear."*  

**Actions Taken:**  
- **Detailed ISE tools and deliverables:**  
  - **Techno-Economic Analysis:** Use LCCA (Life Cycle Cost Analysis) in **GAMS** to ensure cost ≤40 SAR/barrel.  
  - **Process Optimization:** Apply **Six Sigma DMAIC** to reduce energy use by 30%.  
  - **Risk Assessment:** Conduct **HAZOP** studies to achieve zero critical failures in 6 months.  
  - **Automation:** Deploy **Python-based predictive models** (TensorFlow) for real-time efficiency monitoring.  

**Revised Section:**  
> *"ISE students will **optimize costs** via GAMS modeling and **reduce waste** using Six Sigma. **HAZOP** will mitigate risks, while **Python scripts** will automate data logging. Facility layouts will be analyzed via **Arena simulations** to minimize energy use (<10% increase for 2× capacity)."*

### **4. Project Title & Specifications:**
**Comment:**  
*"Title is too vague. Constraints need measurable values."*  

**Actions Taken:**  
- **Revised Title:**  
  *"Development of a **Modular Electrochemical Desulfurization System** for Cost-Effective Oil Refining"*  
- **Added Quantifiable Specs:**  
  - **Desulfurization Rate:** ≥85% (validated via GC analysis).  
  - **Energy Efficiency:** ≤1.2 kWh/barrel (benchmarked against thermal cracking).  

---

### **5. Prototyping Feasibility:**
**Comment:**  
*"Concerns about prototyping implementation."*  

**Actions Taken:**  
- **Outlined Prototyping Phases:**  
  1. **Phase 1 (Lab-Scale):** Build a 1L reactor with manual controls (Weeks 1–6).  
  2. **Phase 2 (Pilot-Scale):** Integrate automation and safety systems (Weeks 7–12).  
- **Resource Allocation:** Use KFUPM’s **Building 75 lab** for GC testing and **Building 59** for circuit assembly.
