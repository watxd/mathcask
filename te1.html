Here's how to comprehensively revise the original file to address all faculty comments (CHE, EE, ISE) with specific changes:

**1. Project Title (Addressing ISE Comment)**
OLD: "Development of Electrochemical processes in Oil refining"
NEW: "Design and Optimization of an Electrochemical Desulfurization System for Sustainable Oil Refining"

**2. Project Description - Added Technical Rigor (CHE Comments)**
Added to Background:
"Using Arrhenius kinetics (k=Ae^(-Ea/RT)) to model temperature dependence and Butler-Volmer equations to optimize electrode performance..."

Added to Proposed Product:
"- **Mathematically modeled reactor design** using Navier-Stokes equations for fluid dynamics and Nernst-Planck equations for ion transport
- **Process optimization algorithms** based on reaction kinetics (1st-order rate constants of 0.15-0.3 min^-1 for sulfur removal)
- **Safety interlock system** designed to ASME BPVC standards"

**3. Multidisciplinary Components - Complete Rewrite**

**CHE Contribution (Addressing Dr. Zahid):**
- **Reactor Design Engineering**:
  • CFD modeling of flow patterns (COMSOL Multiphysics)
  • Electrochemical kinetics modeling (Butler-Volmer equation implementation)
  • Material degradation analysis using Tafel extrapolation methods

- **Process Optimization**:
  • Design of Experiments (DoE) for parameter optimization
  • Aspen Plus simulations for mass/energy balances
  • Hazard analysis using HAZOP methodology

**EE Contribution (Addressing Dr. Brahmi):**
- **Safety-Critical Power System**:
  • UL-certified 0-50V DC supply with overcurrent protection
  • Class I Div 2 rated components for explosive environments
  • PLC-based emergency shutdown (ESD) system meeting IEC 61511 SIL 2

- **Precision Control**:
  • PID-controlled voltage regulation (±0.5V accuracy)
  • IoT-enabled sensor network (Modbus RTU protocol)
  • ATEX-compliant temperature monitoring

**ISE Contribution (Addressing Dr. Al-Maraj):**
- **Advanced Process Optimization**:
  • Six Sigma DMAIC framework implementation
  • Monte Carlo simulation for risk analysis
  • Genetic algorithm-based parameter optimization

- **Techno-Economic Analysis**:
  • Life Cycle Cost Analysis using @RISK software
  • Supply chain optimization via SCOR model
  • Reliability-centered maintenance planning

**4. Anticipated Prototype - Enhanced Technical Specifications**

Added:
- **Safety Systems**:
  • Emergency stop circuit meeting ISO 13850
  • Arc flash protection per NFPA 70E
  • Ground fault interrupters

- **Performance Metrics**:
  • ≤2% voltage ripple (IEEE 519 compliance)
  • MTBF >10,000 hours for critical components
  • ≤5% performance degradation over 500 cycles

**5. New Section: Engineering Design Documentation**
Added deliverables:
- P&ID drawings per ISA 5.1 standards
- FMEA reports with RPN scoring
- CFD simulation validation reports
- Costed Bill of Materials with lead time analysis

**6. Budget - Added Justification**
For each line item, added:
- Engineering design basis (e.g., "Electrolyzer cost based on 2m² membrane area at $300/m²")
- Safety factor calculations
- 3-vendor quotation comparison

**7. Special Concerns - Added Compliance Statements**
New paragraph:
"The design will comply with:
- API RP 500 for electrical area classification
- OSHA 1910.119 for process safety management
- Saudi Aramco SAES standards
- IECEx certification for hazardous areas"

**Implementation Notes:**
1. All equations should use MathType for proper formatting
2. Technical standards should be referenced with exact revision numbers
3. Simulation screenshots should be included in appendices
4. Safety calculations should show margin of safety (e.g., "Relay rated for 200% of max expected current")

This revision addresses:
- CHE: Added rigorous engineering design with mathematical modeling
- EE: Enhanced safety systems with certified components
- ISE: Implemented specific optimization methodologies
While maintaining the original project scope but with significantly more technical depth and compliance documentation.
