High temperatures in R-401 and R-402 are necessary because the desired reaction is slightly endothermic and may be limited by equilibrium. The elevated temperature helps shift the equilibrium to the right and/or accelerates the reaction rate.

A non-stoichiometric feed is used in R-401 and R-402, where high-temperature steam is introduced into the reactor feed. Although steam is not a reactant, it helps shift the equilibrium by diluting the reaction mixture.

The pressure ratio for C-401 is slightly above 3. Given that it is so close to 3, it likely does not justify the expense of adding a second stage with intercooling.

The \(\Delta T_{lm}\) for E-403 and E-404 both exceed \(100^\circ\)C, indicating limited heat integration. However, this setup is simple and cost-effective.
