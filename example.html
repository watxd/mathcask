(a)  

A → D → U  

Let B = D and C = U  

A → B → C  

Balance on A  
\[ v_0C_{AO} - v_0C_A - k_1C_AV = 0 \]  

Balance on B  
\[ 0 - v_0C_B + (k_1C_A - k_2C_B)v = 0 \]  

\[ C_A = \frac{C_{AO}}{1 + \tau k_1} \]  

\[ C_B = \frac{k_1\tau C_A}{1 + k_2\tau} = \frac{\tau k_1C_{AO}}{(1 + k_1\tau)(1 + k_2\tau)} \]  

Balance on C  
\[ 0 - C_Cv_0 + k_2C_BV = 0 \]  

\[ C_C = \tau k_2C_B = \frac{\tau k_2C_{AO}\tau k_1}{(1 + \tau k_1)(1 + \tau k_2)} \]  

\[ S_{B/C} = \frac{C_B}{C_C} = \frac{\tau k_1C_{AO}}{\frac{(1 + \tau k_1)(1 + \tau k_2)}{\tau k_1\tau k_2C_{AO}}} = \frac{1}{\tau k_2}\]  

\[ Y_B = \frac{C_B}{C_{AO} - C_A} = \frac{\tau k_1C_{AO}}{\frac{(1 + \tau k_1)(1 + \tau k_2)}{C_{AO}(1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \tau k_1)})}} = \frac{\tau k_1}{(1 + \tau k_1)(1 + \tau k_2)} \]  

\[ Y_B = \frac{1}{(1 + \tau k_2)} \]
