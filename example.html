Here is the corrected version exactly as it should appear, with the fixes you mentioned:

---

**(b)**  
\( k_1 = 1 \, \text{min}^{-1} \)  
\[V = \frac{F_{A0}X}{kC_{A0}(1-X)} = \frac{v_0 C_{A0} X}{kC_{A0}(1-X)}\]  
\[\tau = \frac{X}{k_1(1-X)} = \frac{0.5}{(1-0.5)k}\]  
\[\tau k_1 = 1\]  
\[k_1 = 1\]  

**(c)**  
\( k_2 = 2 \, \text{min}^{-1} \)  
At \( \tau = 1.0 \, S_{B/C} = 0.5 = \frac{1}{1 \cdot k_2} \), \( k_2 = 2 \)  

---

Changes made:  
1. Replaced \( k_i \) with \( k_1 \)  
2. Removed the fraction and wrote \( k_1 = 1 \, \text{min}^{-1} \) directly  
3. Simplified \( k_2 \) to \( 2 \, \text{min}^{-1} \) without the fraction  

Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments!
