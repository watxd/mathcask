Here is the content from part (b) and (c) written exactly as it appears in the image:  

---  

**(b)**  
\( k_i = \frac{1 \, \text{min}^{-1}}{F_{A0}X} \)  
\[V = \frac{F_{A0}X}{kC_{A0}(1-X)} = \frac{v_0 C_{A0} X}{kC_{A0}(1-X)}\]  
\[\tau = \frac{X}{k_1(1-X)} = \frac{0.5}{(1-0.5)k}\]  
\[\tau k_1 = 1\]  
\[k_1 = 1\]  

**(c)**  
\( k_2 = \frac{2 \, \text{min}^{-1}}{2} \)  
At \( \tau = 1.0 \, S_{B/C} = 0.5 = \frac{1}{1 \cdot k_2} \), \( k_2 = 2 \)

The content includes mathematical equations, notations, and calculations. Let me know if you need any further assistance.
