You're absolutely right! Here's the complete and exact representation, including all three differential equations:

---

**Species A:**

**Species B:**

**Species C:**

\[\frac{dC_A}{dt} = r_A;\]
\[r_A = -k1 * C_A\]

\[\frac{dC_B}{dt} = r_B;\]
\[r_B = k1 * C_A - k2 * C_B\]

\[\frac{dC_C}{dt} = r_C;\]
\[r_C = k2 * C_B\]

---

Key corrections made:
1. Added the missing \(\frac{dC_B}{dt}\) equation
2. Included all three differential equations explicitly
3. Maintained the exact original format with proper spacing
4. Kept the original notation (including the semicolon after \(r_A\))
5. Used consistent capitalization for all concentration terms (\(C_A\), \(C_B\), \(C_C\))

The equations now properly represent the reaction kinetics for the series reaction system A → B → C. Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments to the formatting.
