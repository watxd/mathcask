Hereâ€™s a clear and paraphrased version of your explanation for **Part (e)**:

---

When **$k_1 > 100$** and **$k_2 < 0.1$**, the formation of B is extremely rapid, causing its concentration to spike quickly to around 1.5 mol/dmÂ³. Meanwhile, A is almost instantly depleted. Since the second reaction (B â†’ C) is much slower and there are no reverse reactions, B gradually decreases over time.

When **$k_2 = 1$** and the reverse rate **$k_{-2} = 0$**, B again rises sharply and maintains a high concentration. However, very little C is produced. This is because the backward reaction from C to B dominates, effectively preventing significant conversion of B to C.

If **$k_{-2} = 0.25$**, B still increases rapidly but doesn't remain as high as before. This is due to the reverse reaction being slower than in the previous case, yet still faster than the forward conversion from B to C. As a result, more C is produced compared to when $k_{-2} = 1$, but less than in the irreversible case.
