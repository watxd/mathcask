Certainly. Below is a structured academic-style essay explaining the disinfection mechanism of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), including chemical reactions and discussion on free and residual chlorine.

## **Disinfection Mechanism of Sodium Hypochlorite in Water Treatment**

### **1. Introduction**

Sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) is one of the most widely used chemical disinfectants in water treatment due to its efficacy, availability, and ease of application. Commonly used in both municipal and industrial settings, sodium hypochlorite plays a crucial role in ensuring microbiological safety by inactivating a wide range of pathogens including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. The disinfection capability of NaClO arises from the generation of free chlorine species in water, primarily hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which exhibits strong oxidizing and germicidal properties.

### **2. Chemical Reactions and Formation of Disinfecting Species**

Upon addition to water, sodium hypochlorite dissociates and participates in a series of equilibrium reactions that produce the active disinfectant species.

#### **2.1 Dissociation and Hydrolysis**

Sodium hypochlorite is an inorganic salt that dissociates readily in aqueous solution:

$$
\text{NaClO} \rightarrow \text{Na}^+ + \text{ClO}^-
$$

The hypochlorite ion (ClO⁻) then reacts with water in a pH-dependent equilibrium:

$$
\text{ClO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{HOCl} + \text{OH}^-
$$

The resulting hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is a weak acid and the principal germicidal agent in chlorine-based disinfection systems. This equilibrium reaction is strongly influenced by the solution pH. At lower pH values (approximately 6.5 to 7.5), the formation of HOCl is favored, whereas at higher pH values (above 8), a greater proportion of the chlorine remains in the form of hypochlorite ion (ClO⁻), which is significantly less effective as a disinfectant.

### **3. Free Chlorine and Its Disinfectant Action**

The term **free available chlorine** (FAC) refers to the sum of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypochlorite ion (ClO⁻) present in the solution:

$$
\text{Free Chlorine} = [\text{HOCl}] + [\text{ClO}^-]
$$

Among these, HOCl is approximately 80–100 times more effective as a disinfectant than ClO⁻ due to its higher oxidizing potential and better ability to penetrate microbial cell walls. HOCl reacts with the amino acids, enzymes, and nucleic acids of microorganisms, disrupting metabolic function and resulting in microbial inactivation. The general disinfection reaction can be represented as:

$$
\text{HOCl} + \text{Pathogen} \rightarrow \text{Inactivated Pathogen} + \text{Cl}^- + \text{H}^+
$$

Because of its strong oxidizing nature, HOCl reacts rapidly and non-selectively with many biological molecules, making it highly effective even at low concentrations.

### **4. Residual Chlorine: Free and Combined**

Following the primary disinfection process, a portion of the chlorine remains in the treated water, providing a **residual disinfectant** effect. This is essential for protecting water quality during storage or distribution, where secondary contamination might occur.

Residual chlorine is typically categorized as follows:

* **Free Residual Chlorine:** This includes HOCl and ClO⁻ that remain in the water after the initial reaction with organic and inorganic matter. These species retain their disinfectant properties and are the most desired form of residuals.

* **Combined Residual Chlorine:** This refers to chlorine that has reacted with nitrogenous compounds such as ammonia, forming chloramines (e.g., NH₂Cl, NHCl₂, NCl₃). While chloramines are less potent than free chlorine, they are more stable and provide longer-lasting disinfection over extended distribution networks.

Monitoring residual chlorine concentrations is a critical aspect of water quality control. The presence of an adequate free chlorine residual (typically 0.2–0.5 mg/L in drinking water systems) ensures continuous microbial protection.

### **5. Effect of pH on Disinfection Efficiency**

The efficiency of sodium hypochlorite disinfection is highly dependent on the pH of the water. At pH values below 7.5, the predominant species is HOCl, leading to optimal disinfection performance. As pH increases above 8.0, the equilibrium shifts toward ClO⁻, resulting in a significant reduction in disinfection efficacy.

This pH dependency can be illustrated as follows:

| pH Value | % HOCl | % ClO⁻ | Relative Disinfection Power |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | --------------------------- |
| 6.0      | \~97%  | \~3%   | Maximum                     |
| 7.5      | \~50%  | \~50%  | Moderate                    |
| 8.5      | \~10%  | \~90%  | Low                         |

Therefore, maintaining an appropriate pH is critical in maximizing the effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite disinfection processes.

### **6. Conclusion**

Sodium hypochlorite functions as an effective and versatile disinfectant through its ability to generate hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a potent oxidizing agent. The active chlorine species (HOCl and ClO⁻), collectively known as free chlorine, are primarily responsible for microbial inactivation. The presence of residual chlorine, both free and combined, ensures ongoing protection against contamination in water systems. However, optimal disinfection efficiency is highly dependent on maintaining proper pH conditions to favor HOCl formation. As such, sodium hypochlorite remains a cornerstone in modern water disinfection strategies due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and residual protection capabilities.
