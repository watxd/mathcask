Certainly. Below is a complete, academic-style write-up on the **Pulsa Series® 7120 diaphragm metering pump**, incorporating explanations of the **flow-stroke-pressure relationship**, interpretation of **Table 2** (model selection table), and **Figure 6** (flow vs. pressure envelopes by piston size).

## Pulsa Series® 7120 Diaphragm Metering Pump: Flow, Stroke, and Pressure Analysis

The **Pulsa Series® 7120** is a hydraulically actuated diaphragm metering pump designed for precise and reliable dosing of chemical fluids. It supports **linear stroke length adjustment** and accommodates a wide range of piston sizes and diaphragm styles to meet diverse flow and pressure requirements.

### 1. Flow Rate (Q) in Terms of Stroke Size

The flow rate delivered by the Pulsa 7120 pump is directly proportional to the **piston area**, **stroke length**, and **stroke frequency (SPM)**:

$$
Q = \left( \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \right) \cdot L \cdot \text{SPM}
$$

Where:

* $Q$ = Flow rate (in³/min or converted to GPH/LPH)
* $d$ = Piston diameter (inches)
* $L$ = Stroke length (inches)
* $\text{SPM}$ = Strokes per minute (e.g., 70 or 175 for 60 Hz)

For practical applications, stroke length is controlled as a **percentage of full stroke**, hence:

$$
Q = Q_{\text{max}} \cdot \left( \frac{\text{Stroke \%}}{100} \right)
$$

This provides **linear flow adjustment** from 0% to 100% of maximum rated capacity.

### 2. Table 2 – Specifications and Model Selection

**Table 2** presents flow capacities at rated pressure across various piston sizes, diaphragm styles, and stroke frequencies. The 60 Hz values (70 and 175 SPM) are typically used in North American installations.

#### Key Observations from Table 2:

| Piston Size (in) | Diaphragm Style | Max Pressure (psi) | Flow Range at 60 Hz (GPH) |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 0.375            | M               | 3000               | 1.2 – 2.4                 |
| 0.5              | TM / THM        | 2000 / 600         | 2.3 – 7.1                 |
| 0.75             | T / TM / THM    | 1200 – 600         | 6.8 – 18.5                |
| 1.0              | THM             | 600                | 13.2 – 33                 |
| 1.25             | TM              | 440                | 21.4 – 54                 |
| 1.5              | THM             | 300                | 31 – 77                   |
| 1.75             | THM             | 225                | 42 – 105                  |
| 2.125            | THM             | 150                | 62 – 155                  |
| 2.625            | TH              | 100                | 94 – 235                  |

#### Interpretation:

* **Higher piston sizes** correspond to **higher flow capacity**, as expected from the volumetric relationship $A \propto d^2$.
* **Rated pressure decreases** with increasing piston diameter due to larger diaphragm surface area, which lowers pressure-handling capability.
* **Diaphragm style** affects pressure rating: **Metal (M)** supports highest pressures, while **HydraTube (H)** variants offer flexibility and chemical compatibility at moderate pressures.

### 3. Figure 6 – Flow & Pressure Envelope by Piston Size

**Figure 6** graphically depicts the operating range of each piston size in terms of **flow (GPH or LPH)** on the x-axis and **maximum pressure (psi/bar)** on the y-axis.

#### Interpretation of Figure 6:

* The **left graph** shows smaller pistons (0.375–1.0 in):
   • Piston 0.375″ reaches **3000 psi** but offers minimal flow (2.4 GPH max).
   • Piston 1.0″ reaches only **600 psi** but offers \~33 GPH.
* The **right graph** shows larger pistons (1.25–2.625 in):
   • As piston size increases, **flow capacity rises rapidly**.
   • However, **maximum allowable pressure drops** significantly (down to 100 psi for 2.625″).
   • The region for each piston is a trapezoidal envelope, showing **upper limits** at full stroke and pressure combinations.

This confirms the inverse relationship between **flow capacity and pressure** across the piston sizes—a trade-off intrinsic to reciprocating metering pump design.
