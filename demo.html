### 1. Introduction and Background (30%)

#### History and Relevance of Polymer Composites in Boat Manufacturing
The marine industry has adopted fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites extensively over the past 50 years. Their initial application was in small craft production due to the significant benefits offered, such as light weight, high durability, and resistance to corrosion and fatigue (Neser, 2017). Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) became a preferred material by the 1970s, dominating recreational boat manufacturing (Neser, 2017).

Composites like GRP and carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers have proven critical in enhancing performance, reducing emissions, and meeting sustainability goals. Their use in structures such as hulls, decks, and superstructures leads to a lighter design, improving speed and fuel economy while lowering maintenance needs (Baley et al., 2024; Neser, 2017).

#### Materials Used
Marine composites typically include:
- **Matrix Materials:** Polyester, vinyl ester, epoxy resins
- **Reinforcements:** Glass fiber (GFRP), carbon fiber, aramid
- **Core Materials (for sandwich construction):** PVC foam, balsa wood

#### Fabrication Methods
- **Hand lay-up:** Traditional but labor-intensive
- **Vacuum infusion:** Reduces resin use and emissions (Baley et al., 2024)
- **Spray lay-up and resin transfer molding (RTM):** Efficient for complex shapes
- **Autoclave molding:** Used for high-performance parts

Vacuum infusion, for instance, cuts down on raw material waste and improves fiber volume fraction, reducing long-term operational costs and emissions (Baley et al., 2024).

#### Key Properties
Polymer composites offer:
- High strength-to-weight ratio
- Corrosion and fatigue resistance
- Superior impact tolerance
- Design flexibility

These characteristics make polymer composites particularly suitable for marine applications (Baley et al., 2024; Neser, 2017; Dhandapani et al., 2024).

### 2. Current Materials: Advantages and Disadvantages (10%)

| Material | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) | Cost-effective, durable, low maintenance | Difficult to recycle, emits VOCs during production (Baley et al., 2024; Neser, 2017) |
| Carbon Fiber Composites | Lightweight, high strength and stiffness | High cost, energy-intensive production (Baley et al., 2024) |
| Biocomposites (e.g., flax, jute) | Renewable, biodegradable, lower carbon footprint | Lower mechanical properties, durability concerns (Baley et al., 2024; Dhandapani et al., 2024) |

### 3. Research Gap (10%)
Despite advancements, key challenges persist:
- Limited recycling of thermoset composites due to cross-linked structures (Neser, 2017; Dhandapani et al., 2024)
- Incomplete integration of end-of-life strategies in early design stages (Baley et al., 2024)
- Mechanical limitations of bio-based composites restrict their mainstream use (Dhandapani et al., 2024)
- Difficulty in separating bonded core materials during recycling (Baley et al., 2024)

Abandoned composite vessels pose significant environmental risks due to their non-degradable nature and embedded hazardous materials (Baley et al., 2024; Dhandapani et al., 2024). According to recent studies, GRP vessels have created a rising problem in marine waste, particularly in estuarine and coastal zones where abandoned boats accumulate and contribute to microplastic pollution (Dhandapani et al., 2024).

### 4. Proposed Strategies and Opinions (30%)

#### Solutions by Researchers
- **Use of thermoplastic resins** that are recyclable and remoldable (Baley et al., 2024; Dhandapani et al., 2024)
- **Development of green composites** incorporating marine and plant-based fibers (Dhandapani et al., 2024)
- **Adoption of closed-mold processes** to reduce VOCs and improve workplace safety (Neser, 2017)
- **Mechanical recycling technologies** for shredded GRP used in secondary applications like artificial wood or construction materials (Dhandapani et al., 2024)

#### Proposed Design Improvements
1. **Hybrid Composites:** Blend natural fibers with carbon or glass for performance optimization (Baley et al., 2024; Dhandapani et al., 2024).
2. **Modular Construction:** Enables disassembly and reuse/recycling of components (Baley et al., 2024).
3. **Digital Traceability Tags:** Embedding RFID or QR codes to detail material composition (Baley et al., 2024).
4. **Integrated LCA Tools:** Enhance design decisions by simulating environmental impacts early on (Baley et al., 2024; Neser, 2017).
5. **Incorporation of recycled GRP filler** in structural or non-load-bearing boat components to reduce landfill waste (Dhandapani et al., 2024).

These strategies can bridge the gap between functionality, sustainability, and regulatory compliance in boat design.

### 5. Expected Results and Conclusions (10%)

Implementing these design and material strategies is projected to:
- Reduce boat weight by 20–50%, leading to fuel efficiency improvements (Baley et al., 2024)
- Lower lifecycle environmental footprint
- Facilitate recycling and responsible disposal at end-of-life (Dhandapani et al., 2024)
- Match or exceed mechanical performance standards of traditional GRP boats (Baley et al., 2024; Dhandapani et al., 2024)

Polymer composite-based boats, when designed sustainably, present a transformative path forward for marine engineering.
