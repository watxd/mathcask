**Technical Comparison Report: DuCoNite 15 Hose Pump vs. Pulsa Series 7120 Diaphragm Pump for Sodium Hypochlorite Dosing**

---

**1. Introduction**

This report presents a technical analysis and comparison between two chemical dosing pumps: the DuCoNite® 15 hose pump and the Pulsa Series® 7120 hydraulic diaphragm metering pump. Both pumps are evaluated for their suitability in handling sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) dosing in water treatment applications.

**2. Hose Pump Working Principle (Refer to Figure 7)**

Hose pumps, also called peristaltic pumps, transport fluids through the mechanical compression of a flexible hose. Figure 7 illustrates the operational mechanism:

* A rotor with rollers compresses the hose along a circular path.
* The fluid is pushed forward within the sealed section of the hose.
* As the roller releases, the hose re-expands, drawing in more fluid via vacuum.

**Advantages:**

* No valves or seals
* Fully self-priming
* Dry-running capability
* Excellent for abrasive, viscous, or gas-forming fluids

**3. DuCoNite® 15 Hose Pump Overview**

The DuCoNite 15 is an industrial-grade hose pump engineered by Bredel/Watson-Marlow. It is especially suited for corrosive and shear-sensitive chemicals like sodium hypochlorite.

**Key Features:**

* Max continuous flow: 375 L/h (99 USGPH)
* Max intermittent flow: 525 L/h (139 USGPH)
* Max pressure: 12 bar (174 psi)
* Max continuous speed: 75 rpm
* Fully reversible and dry-run capable
* Constructed with DuCoNite-coated cast iron and 316 SS hardware
* Hose materials: CSM, EPDM, NBR, NR variants

**4. Operating Envelope (Figure 9)**

Figure 9 plots motor power, pump speed, pressure, and product temperature.

**Interpretation:**

* Green zone: Continuous operation up to 40°C
* Yellow zone: Intermittent duty (max 3 hours on, 1 hour off)
* Flow and pressure determine pump speed and power requirement

*Example:* At 375 L/h and 400 kPa (58 psi), continuous operation is allowed with motor power of \~0.25 kW.

**8. Conclusion**

The DuCoNite 15 offers a low-maintenance, self-priming solution ideal for handling gas-forming, corrosive chemicals like sodium hypochlorite. Its simplicity, reversibility, and dry-running capabilities make it highly reliable in water treatment environments.

In contrast, the Pulsa 7120 excels in high-pressure, precision-controlled dosing scenarios with regulatory compliance. However, it is more sensitive to gas-locking and requires regular maintenance.

A trial installation of the DuCoNite 15 is recommended to assess its long-term suitability as a replacement for diaphragm pumps in sodium hypochlorite injection systems.
