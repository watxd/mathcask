Here’s an academic-style explanation of how **DPD powder** is used to measure **free chlorine** using a **pocket colorimeter** or portable chlorine analyzer:

## **Measurement of Free Chlorine Using DPD Powder and a Pocket Colorimeter**

### **1. Introduction**

Monitoring free chlorine concentration is a critical component of water quality control in drinking water treatment, swimming pools, and industrial water systems. One of the most widely used field methods involves the use of **DPD (N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine)** reagents in combination with a **portable colorimeter**, such as a pocket chlorine meter. This method offers rapid, accurate, and reliable measurements of free chlorine in water samples.

### **2. Principle of the DPD Method**

The DPD method is a **colorimetric technique** in which the presence of free chlorine (HOCl and ClO⁻) reacts with DPD powder to produce a **pink-magenta colored complex**. The intensity of this color is directly proportional to the concentration of free chlorine in the water sample.

$$
\text{HOCl} + \text{DPD (colorless)} \rightarrow \text{DPD⁺ (pink)} + \text{Cl}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

Only free chlorine (i.e., hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ion) reacts instantly with the DPD reagent to form this color. Combined chlorine (e.g., chloramines) can also be measured with a second reagent (DPD No. 3), but is not involved in the initial free chlorine test.

### **3. Procedure Using a Pocket Colorimeter**

1. **Sample Collection**: A clean, chlorine-demand-free glass vial is filled with a specified volume (typically 10 mL) of the water sample.

2. **Addition of DPD Powder**: One DPD reagent powder pillow (commonly known as **DPD Free Chlorine Reagent**) is added to the sample vial and mixed thoroughly.

3. **Color Development**: Within seconds, a pink color appears if free chlorine is present. The reaction is immediate and stable for a few minutes.

4. **Measurement**: The vial is inserted into the **pocket colorimeter**, which uses a light beam (usually at 530 nm) to measure the intensity of the pink color via **photometric detection**.

5. **Reading**: The device displays the free chlorine concentration in **mg/L (ppm)**.

### **5. Applications**

* **Municipal water treatment plants**
* **Industrial water disinfection**
* **Swimming pool maintenance**
* **Field verification of residual chlorine**

### **6. Conclusion**

The DPD-powder method, when used with a pocket free chlorine colorimeter, is a reliable and standardized technique for measuring free chlorine in water systems. Its simplicity and portability make it suitable for routine monitoring in both laboratory and field environments. The method's accuracy depends on timely color development and consistent reagent handling, ensuring dependable control of chlorine disinfection levels.
