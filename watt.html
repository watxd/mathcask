### **Energy Balance Equation for a Nonisothermal Batch Reactor**

For a **batch reactor**, the general energy balance is derived from the **First Law of Thermodynamics**, which accounts for the accumulation of energy within the system. The equation is:

\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{Q} + \dot{W}
\]

Where:
- \(\frac{dE}{dt}\) = Rate of energy accumulation in the system.
- \(\dot{Q}\) = Rate of heat added to the system.
- \(\dot{W}\) = Rate of work done on the system.

---

### **Step-by-Step Derivation**

#### **1. Total Energy of the System**
The total energy (\(E\)) consists of **internal energy (\(U\))**, **kinetic energy (KE)**, and **potential energy (PE)**. For most chemical reactors, KE and PE are negligible, so:

\[
E \approx U
\]

Thus, the rate of energy accumulation is:

\[
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{dU}{dt}
\]

#### **2. Work Done on the System (\(\dot{W}\))**
The work term includes:
- **Flow work** (irrelevant for batch reactors, as there is no continuous flow).
- **Shaft work** (\(W_s\), e.g., stirring).
- **Boundary work** (\(W_b\), due to volume changes).

For a batch reactor with negligible shaft work and constant volume (no boundary work):

\[
\dot{W} \approx 0
\]

#### **3. Heat Added to the System (\(\dot{Q}\))**
This represents heat exchange with the surroundings (e.g., heating/cooling jackets):

\[
\dot{Q} = UA(T' - T)
\]

Where:
- \(U\) = Overall heat transfer coefficient.
- \(A\) = Heat transfer area.
- \(T'\) = Temperature of the heating/cooling medium.
- \(T\) = Reactor temperature.

#### **4. Internal Energy Change (\(\frac{dU}{dt}\))**
For a reacting mixture, internal energy depends on:
- **Temperature (\(T\))**
- **Composition (moles of species, \(N_i\))**

Using **enthalpy (\(H = U + PV\))** and assuming constant pressure:

\[
\frac{dU}{dt} = \frac{dH}{dt} - P \frac{dV}{dt}
\]

For a **constant-volume batch reactor** (\(\frac{dV}{dt} = 0\)):

\[
\frac{dU}{dt} = \frac{dH}{dt}
\]

The enthalpy change is due to:
- **Sensible heat** (temperature change).
- **Heat of reaction (\(\Delta H_{RX}\))**.

Thus:

\[
\frac{dH}{dt} = \sum_{i} N_i C_{pi} \frac{dT}{dt} + \Delta H_{RX}(T) \cdot rV
\]

Where:
- \(N_i\) = Moles of species \(i\).
- \(C_{pi}\) = Heat capacity of species \(i\).
- \(r\) = Reaction rate.
- \(V\) = Reactor volume.

#### **5. Final Energy Balance**
Combining all terms:

\[
\sum_{i} N_i C_{pi} \frac{dT}{dt} = \dot{Q} - \Delta H_{RX}(T) \cdot rV
\]

For an **adiabatic batch reactor (\(\dot{Q} = 0\))**:

\[
\sum_{i} N_i C_{pi} \frac{dT}{dt} = -\Delta H_{RX}(T) \cdot rV
\]

For a **non-adiabatic reactor with heat exchange**:

\[
\sum_{i} N_i C_{pi} \frac{dT}{dt} = UA(T' - T) - \Delta H_{RX}(T) \cdot rV
\]

---

### **Key Equations Summary**
1. **General Form (Non-adiabatic Batch Reactor):**
   \[
   \frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{UA(T' - T) - \Delta H_{RX}(T) \cdot rV}{\sum_{i} N_i C_{pi}}
   \]

2. **Adiabatic Batch Reactor (\(\dot{Q} = 0\)):**
   \[
   \frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{-\Delta H_{RX}(T) \cdot rV}{\sum_{i} N_i C_{pi}}
   \]

3. **Relating Temperature and Conversion (Adiabatic Case):**
   \[
   T = T_o + \frac{[-\Delta H_{RX}(T)]}{\sum_{i} \theta_i C_{pi}} X
   \]

---

### **Physical Interpretation**
- **Exothermic Reaction (\(\Delta H_{RX} < 0\)):** Temperature increases with conversion.
- **Endothermic Reaction (\(\Delta H_{RX} > 0\)):** Temperature decreases with conversion.
- **Heat Exchange (\(\dot{Q}\)):** Controls temperature by adding/removing heat.

This derivation ensures proper coupling between **reaction kinetics** and **energy balance**, crucial for designing safe and efficient batch reactors.
