Awesome—here’s a ready-to-drop write-up for **Sections 1.1–1.3** tailored to your Team 30 project (Electrochemical Desulfurization, CHE/EE/ISE), matching the flow of your deck.&#x20;

# 1.1 Overview

Conventional hydrodesulfurization (HDS) achieves very low sulfur but at **high temperature/pressure** with **hydrogen** and **expensive catalysts**, driving cost and emissions. Our project investigates a **batch electrochemical desulfurization (ECDS)** reactor that operates at **mild temperature (\~60–95 °C)** and **ambient pressure (\~1 atm)**. The design integrates safe low-voltage power, sensing, and data logging to quantify **sulfur removal (%/ppm)**, **specific energy (Wh/L)**, and **reliability**. The expected outcome is proof that **ULSD-class or model-fuel sulfur targets** can be met **without HDS-level severity**, enabling safer, lower-energy refining options and a compact, modular prototype suited for lab validation and future scale-up.

# 1.2 Introduction

## i) Need for the Product

* **Regulatory pressure:** Ultra-low sulfur limits (e.g., 10–15 ppm) require robust desulfurization; HDS meets spec but increases **CAPEX/OPEX** and **CO₂ footprint** due to high T/P and H₂.
* **Operational risk & complexity:** High-pressure hydrogen systems add safety, maintenance, and catalyst management burdens.
* **Measurement & agility:** Refineries and R\&D groups want **instrumented, modular** units for rapid learning (current density, energy per liter, selectivity) at **mild conditions**.
* **Our response:** A **bench-scale ECDS** that demonstrates **spec-compliant sulfur removal** at **\~1 atm**, with full data capture and safety interlocks.

## ii) Relevance to Industry

* **Sectors impacted:** Refining (diesel/kerosene), petrochemicals (naphtha cuts), specialty fuels (marine/aviation), and pilot/demo facilities.
* **Trends aligned:**

  * **Electrification of processes** (replace part of heat/H₂ duty with electrons).
  * **Decarbonization** (lower energy intensity and cleaner operation).
  * **Modularity & retrofits** (skid-mounted, easy integration).
  * **Digitalization** (continuous logging of V/I/T → traceable KPIs).
* **Value proposition:** If ECDS meets sulfur targets at mild conditions with competitive **Wh/L** and acceptable **electrode life**, it can **de-risk** portions of desulfurization, complement HDS, or serve as a **pre/post-treat** step.

## iii) Evaluation of Current Solutions

* **Hydrodesulfurization (HDS):** Proven, deep desulfurization; **disadvantages**—high T/P, H₂ supply, catalyst cost/sensitivity (poisoning), large footprint and safety complexity.
* **Oxidative desulfurization (ODS):** Uses oxidants (e.g., H₂O₂) to convert sulfur species then extract; simpler hardware but **chemical consumables** and **waste handling**.
* **Adsorptive methods:** Selective sorbents remove sulfur; **periodic regeneration** and capacity limits raise cost and waste concerns.
* **Biodesulfurization:** Operates mild, but **slow kinetics** and complex bioprocess control.
* **Electrochemical approaches (research):** Growing evidence of selective sulfur removal at low T/P; challenges are **electrode durability**, **side reactions**, and **energy efficiency**.
  **Gap our design addresses:** instrumented **ambient-pressure ECDS** that reports **sulfur ppm**, **Wh/L**, and **durability** with clear safety and maintainability—i.e., **data-rich benchmarking** against HDS-style performance expectations.

# 1.3 Fundamental Scientific and Engineering Concepts

## i) Relevant Scientific & Computational Techniques

**Electrochemistry & transport**

* **Faraday’s law (charge → moles):**
  $n = \dfrac{I\,t}{zF}$ (moles reacted), where $I$ = current, $t$ = time, $z$ = electrons per reaction, $F$ = 96485 C/mol.
  **Faradaic (coulombic) efficiency**: fraction of charge that actually removes sulfur.
* **Current density & area:**
  $J = \dfrac{I}{A}$ (A m⁻²). Controls rate; links to **mass-transfer** and **selectivity**.
* **Kinetics & overpotential:**
  Butler–Volmer/Tafel—activation overpotential and side reactions; **ohmic drop** (iR) and **mass-transfer limit** $i_L = n F k_L C$.
* **Thermodynamics/Nernst:** Redox potentials and driving force for target sulfur species vs. competing reactions.

**Energy & performance metrics**

* **Specific energy (term-project KPI):**
  $E_{\text{spec}} = \dfrac{\displaystyle\int V(t)I(t)\,dt}{V_{\text{processed}}} \approx \dfrac{V_{\text{avg}} I_{\text{avg}} t}{V_b}$ (Wh L⁻¹).
* **Sulfur removal efficiency:**
  $\eta_S = 100\cdot \dfrac{S_{\text{in}}-S_{\text{out}}}{S_{\text{in}}}\ \%$ (ppm or % basis).
* **Electrode durability:** performance decay < 10% after \~10 h cumulative run (lab target).

**Simple computational/analytical tools**

* **0-D mass balance** for sulfur species across a batch.
* **DoE/statistics (ISE)** to plan **T–J** sweeps and analyze sensitivity.
* **Event detection** from time-series (EE): uptime, trips, MTBF/MTTR.
* (Optional) **Equivalent circuit** (ohmic + charge-transfer + diffusion) to interpret V–I data.

*(Diagrams/flowcharts to include in the report:)* block diagram of PSU→controller→reactor, sensor feedback loop, and a simple flow of data logging to KPIs (ηₛ, Wh/L, durability).

* **Quality target:** **ULSD-class** or **model-fuel sulfur** to spec; validated sampling/analysis.

**Electrical Engineering (EE)**

* **Circuit & power electronics:** safe **low-voltage DC**, current-controlled operation (PWM/buck).
* **Measurement & DAQ:** V/I/T sensing, calibration, **1 s logging**, data integrity.
* **Protection/interlocks:** **E-stop**, relay trip (< 1 s), over-current/over-temp cutbacks; wiring per good practice.

**Industrial & Systems Engineering (ISE)**

* **Process capability & quality:** repeatability, control charts for ηₛ and Wh/L.
* **Cost & maintainability:** consumables tracking (mL/L, SAR/L), preventive checks, uptime metrics.

* **Durability:** < 10% performance drop after \~10 h.
* **Uptime:** ≥ 98% over 3×1 h runs; ≤ 1 unplanned trip.
