I'll analyze the Excel file to ensure the constraints, specifications, and integrated specifications align with the provided guideline. Let me process the file and extract the relevant structure.

The Excel file contains a sheet named **"251-Specifications"**. I'll now extract its contents to understand the formatting and structure.

The Excel file includes structured data on constraints and specifications, categorizing them as **"Off-the-Shelf"** or **"Project Specific"** across different disciplines (CHE, EE, ISE, ME, etc.). I'll now align the suggested constraints, specifications, and integrated specifications accordingly.

Hereâ€™s the classification of **constraints, specifications, and integrated specifications** based on whether they are **Off-the-Shelf (OTS)** or **Project-Specific (PS)**:

---

| **Process Safety** (Compliance with OSHA & API) | ISE | **OTS** |
| **Economic Viability** (Cost â‰¤ 20% of conventional refining) | ISE | **PS** |
| **Power Efficiency** (â‰¥85% efficiency) | EE | **PS** |

| **Real-time Monitoring (Update rate: 1s, Accuracy: Â±2%)** | EE | **PS** |
| **IoT Integration for Automation** | EE | **PS** |
| **Electrochemical Conversion Efficiency** (â‰¥80%) | CHE | **PS** |
| **Selective Hydrocarbon Production** (â‰¥90% gasoline/diesel selectivity) | CHE | **PS** |
| **Catalyst Stability** (â‰¥90% efficiency after 100 hours) | CHE | **PS** |
| **Temperature Control** (50Â°Câ€“150Â°C) | CHE | **PS** |
| **Process Cost Reduction** (â‰¥30% lower than conventional refining) | ISE | **PS** |
| **Automation Efficiency** (â‰¥95% automation) | ISE | **PS** |
| **Risk Mitigation** (Zero critical failures in 6 months) | ISE | **PS** |
| **Waste Management Compliance** (95% waste neutralization) | ISE | **PS** |

### **Integrated Specifications**
| Integrated Specification | Departments Involved | Classification |
|--------------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **System Energy Efficiency** (â‰¥70% overall efficiency) | EE + CHE + ISE | **PS** |
| **Sustainability and Emission Reduction** (â‰¥40% COâ‚‚ & SOâ‚‚ reduction) | CHE + ISE | **PS** |
| **Operational Scalability** (2Ã— capacity increase with â‰¤10% energy rise) | EE + CHE + ISE | **PS** |

This classification follows the **example Excel file structure**, balancing **Off-the-Shelf (OTS) and Project-Specific (PS) constraints and specifications** as per project needs. Let me know if you need refinements! ðŸš€
